# Welcome to the URL Shortener Application!

Steps to setting up the application (still to be extensively updated accordingly)

1) Got to the GitHub repository link, and clone it to the directory of your choice on your local machine.
2) Open the terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
   1. Run `cd ui` to get to the `/ui` directory.
   2. Run the command: `yarn start`
3) Open another terminal window/tab.
   1. Run `cd server` to get to the `/server` directory.
   2. Run the command: `yarn dev`
4) ... more steps to be updated if needed

# Fair Warning

This is for testing the application on the local machine.
You might not have all the configurations made and/or the tools installed.
I still have yet to figure out deployment and writing tests for the application, but for now this is the first prototype url-shortener I created.
